			<h1>Body shape: Curvy/Hourglass Shaped</h1>
			<p><u>Cardio</u>
			    :5-7 days/week
				<br>
				Try combining the all over benefits of running with the calorie-torching effects of interval training, which involves alternating your pace frequently between a high-intensity speed and lower intensity recovery bouts. Check out this HIIT Cardio workout example:
				</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Warm-up by walking 5 minutes</li>
				<li>Run 2 minutes at 80% of your max pace</li>
				<li>Jog or Walk 2-3 minutes at an easy pace for recovery</li>
				<li>Repeat 5 times for a total interval time of 20-25 minutes</li>
				<li>Cool-down by walking 5 minutes</li>
				</ol>
			<p><u>Weight Room Exercises</u>
			    : 2-3 days/week
			   <br>
			   Start with 2-3 sets of 5-12 repetitions for each exercise, and that they take a one to two minute rest period between sets.
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Plank hold</strong>
				: Lying on your stomach, lift up onto your elbows and the balls of your feet and keeping body straight in a plank position, and hold for 10-20 seconds. Looking to add an edge? Perform the same motion but while balancing on one foot or by placing your feet on a large exercise ball, while keeping elbows on the floor.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Tricep extension squat</strong>
				: While performing a traditional squat, hold one dumbbell with both hands over your head. When you bend your knees, simultaneously lower the dumbbell slowly behind you and then back up again, making sure to keep your weight in your heels.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Lateral Pull Down</strong>
				: Find a weight machine that includes a cable and hanging bar, then adjust the weight accordingly. Place your hands wider than shoulder width apart with an overhand grip on the bar, and pull the bar down slowly in front of the body with the elbows pushing straight down. Once the bar is parallel with your chest, straighten your arms back up to an almost locked out position to complete one rep.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>1 Arm Bent Dumbbell Row</strong>
				: To start, kneel over an exercise bench, and place your inside hand on the bench so your shoulder is directly over your elbow and wrist, and keep your outside foot planted on the ground. Hold a dumbbell in your outside hand with an overhand grip. Lift the dumbbell up until your arm comes to a ninety-degree angle, and lower back down, ensuring to keep your back straight and core tight. This one benefits both back and arm muscles!
