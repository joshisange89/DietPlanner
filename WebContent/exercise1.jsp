			<h1>Body shape: Pear shaped</h1>
			<p><u>Cardio</u>
			    :5-7 days/week
				<br>
				 Spend 30-60 minutes on the stationary bike or rower, as the added resistance will not only burn calories but also increase overall muscle tone in the legs and backside.
			</p>
			<p><u>Weight Room Exercises</u>
			    : 2-3 days/week
			   <br>
			    Start with 2-3 sets of 5-12 repetitions for each exercise, and that they take a one to two minute rest period between sets.
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Squats</strong>
				:Start with feet a bit wider than shoulder width apart. Bend at the knees slowly and move your buttocks back and down, going as deep as you are able but stopping when your thighs are parallel to the ground. Also ensure that youâ€™re keeping your weight in your heels, chest up, and that your knees do not go over your toes. Hold free weights during this exercise for an added challenge.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Walking lunges</strong>
				: Keeping hips centered, step forward with one foot and bend at the knees, making sure to keep your back and upper body straight, your feet aligned, and not allowing your knees to go over your toes. Free weights are a great addition to work the upper body on this as well!
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Machine-free leg curl</strong>
				: While lying on your back, place your feet together on top of a large exercise ball. Bracing your core and glutes, bring feet in towards your body, bending at the knees and maintaining a straight back. This one is great for targeting the back of the thighs and your butt muscles!
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Calf raises</strong>
				: Keeping feet forward and shoulder width apart, core tight, and back straight, slowly raise to the balls of your feet, then slowly back down to your heels. Continue this motion for the remainder of your reps.
			</li>
