		RIO DE JANEIRO — The celebration, as expected, started even before the Olympic gymnastics team final was over, even before the final beat of music accompanying the United States’ final event, the floor exercise, blasted through the loudspeakers.

		The American women began to clap and hug and gathered together to stand, shoulder-to-shoulder, as Simone Biles, their star, finished her floor routine.

		Why not celebrate early? The Americans were expected to win by a landslide on Tuesday, and then did. It wasn’t even close.

		Once Biles finished her routine — sealing an 8-point victory, a grand canyon of a gap in a sport that calculates margins by thousandths of a point — her teammates ran to her and joined each other in a sparkly group hug. The only problem with their huddle was that one important person was missing: Martha Karolyi, the longtime women’s national team coordinator.

		Come to think of it, important isn’t the right word to describe what Karolyi has meant to this United States team, and the entire women’s program, since she took over in 2001.

		Invaluable is more like it.

		Karolyi, 73, is retiring after these Games. So this was her final gold medal. Her final Olympics after about 40 years in the sport. As her team celebrated, she gripped the railing in front of her seat in the grandstands, wiped beneath her eyes, and smiled.

		Quiet, serious Martha Karolyi. That’s how the public knows her. Quiet and serious, compared to her husband, Bela, who as a coach was as boisterous as they come.

		Her career started in Romania, where she and Bela became a coaching power couple, eventually training the Olympic champion Nadia Comaneci before coming to the United States.

		Since then, the Karolyis have had a transformative effect on the United States team, which recently has flourished under Martha’s guidance. The United States women’s team now has won the last five major international competitions. Since Martha Karolyi took charge in 2001, replacing her husband, the program has revamped the way the United States team trains.
