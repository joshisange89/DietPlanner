			<h1>Body shape: Apple shaped</h1>
			<p><u>Cardio</u>
			    :5-7 days/week
				<br>
				 Try the elliptical machine for 30-60 minutes, which provides a cardio workout that also adds arm resistance and overall body toning. Many newer machines have a “arm blaster” option, which ups the resistance significantly in short bursts.
			</p>
			<p><u>Weight Room Exercises</u>
			    : 2-3 days/week
			   <br>
			    Start with 2-3 sets of 5-12 repetitions for each exercise, and that they take a one to two minute rest period between sets.
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Crunches</strong>
				:While this classic ab work out can get a bit boring, advanced lifters can try performing crunches while sitting on a large exercise ball or while holding a weighted medicine ball. Just remember to keep that core tight!
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Triangle push up</strong>
				: Similar to a normal push-up, the only difference being that your hands are placed directly below the center of the chest in a triangle formation, targeting both arm and core muscle groups! Just remember to keep your core tight and avoid arching your back.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Hammer curls</strong>
				: Holding a free weight in each hand, stand with feet shoulder width apart and keep palms facing inward. Keeping your elbows at your sides, raise one weight until forearm is vertical and the side of the dumbbell is facing you. Continue alternating for the remainder of the repetitions.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Tricep extensions</strong>
				: Keeping feet shoulder width apart, hold one dumbbell with both hands over your head. Lower the dumbbell slowly behind your head, and slowly back up to complete on repetition. Keep your core tight and avoid arching your back.
