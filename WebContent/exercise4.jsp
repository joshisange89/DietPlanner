			<h1>Body shape: Banana/Straight Shaped</h1>
			<p><u>Cardio</u>
			    :5-7 days/week
				<br>
				Girls built on the straight side should use the stair stepper machine for 30-60 minutes, or walk/run using the incline feature on the treadmill in order to build muscle mass as well burn calories. Running outside is always a solid option as well, as it provides natural inclines, all of which helps to develop muscular and cardiovascular endurance.
			</p>
			<p><u>Weight Room Exercises</u>
			    : 2-3 days/week
			   <br>
			   Start with 2-3 sets of 5-12 repetitions for each exercise, and that they take a one to two minute rest period between sets.
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Leg Press</strong>
				: Upon sitting at the leg press machine, place feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart against the metal surface that faces the chair, so that knees are bent but you are still comfortable. Press back with both feet, extending legs until they are almost completely straight, and then return to the bent starting position. This oneâ€™s great because it works the glutes, hamstrings, quadriceps and calf muscles at the same time, creating muscle tone all over.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Shoulder press</strong>
				: Start by sitting in an exercise chair holding dumbbells on either side of your shoulders, with arms bent at the elbow. Slowly lift both weights up and towards each other, so that they are almost touching above your head, then return to the original position.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Bench press</strong>
				: Lie flat on an exercise bench with each foot flat on the floor and your entire back in contact with the bench. Holding the bar above the center of your chest with arms bent and hands slightly wider than shoulder width, slowly lift the bar directly up until arms are almost straight, and slowly return to the original starting position. Add extra weight accordingly, and make sure to always have a spotter!
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Dumbbell Fly</strong>
				: Lie down on an exercise bench with each foot flat on the floor and your entire back in contact with the bench. With dumbbells in each hand, lift the weights directly above you with your palms facing each other. Keeping a slight bend in the elbows, slowly lower the weights outward and downward in an arching motion. Go as low as you feel comfortable and then simultaneously bring the weights back up to the starting position.
